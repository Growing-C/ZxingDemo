an AS demo for repository Zxing, a well know frame for QR code.  this demo contains two modules .

There are two modules in this demo project .
Module  app is just a copy of the well known frame Zxing (https://github.com/zxing/zxing ). As you can see, there are four android-related packages in the Zxing repository, and I have added them all to my module app.
The android package in Zxing is the basic android project ,the android-core package is addtional for camera config.These two package are the basic of my module app.
The androidtest package in Zxing is a test android project , I added this package to my module app and its contents are in my package test ,with the android-integration package in Zxing.
Module app is just a simple combination of Zxing android support packages without any modification, you can run this module to see how to use the Zxing frame.

Module Simplifiedzxingdemo is a simplified version of Zxing . In this module I removed some functions to make the frame easier to use.
